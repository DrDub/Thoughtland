Thoughtland - Describing n-dimensional Objects
==============================================

Thoughtland is an end-to-end system that produces an English
text summarizing the error function of a machine learning
algorithm applied to some training data.

Thoughtland is a four stages pipeline:

* [Cloud] Cloud of points generation via cross-validation
* [Cluster] Model-based clustering to identify interesting components of the error function 
* [Analysis] Identify further relation between the key components
* [Generation] Natural language generation to produce an English text summarizing the error function.


Building Thoughtland
--------------------

Thoughtland uses Maven but you will need to deploy locally some dependencies that haven't made their way into Central yet.

They are:

* OpenSchema

git clone git://github.com/DrDub/openschema.git
(cd openschema; mvn install)

* SimpleNLG

Download http://simplenlg.googlecode.com/files/simplenlg-v44.zip and extract it to some folder

do

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/path/to/simplenlg/lib/lexAccess2011dist.jar -DgroupId=lexAccess2011dist -DartifactId=lexAccess2011dist -Dversion=1.0.0 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/path/to/simplenlg/lib/lvg2011api.jar -DgroupId=lvg2011api -DartifactId=lvg2011api -Dversion=1.0.0 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true

then

git clone git://github.com/DrDub/simplenlg.git

and

mvn install


Running Thoughtland
-------------------

(For an example command-line use, take a look at App.scala)

mvn clean compile assembly:single

java -jar /full/path/to/project/target/thoughtland-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

should start a web-browser at http://localhost:7071


Hacking Thoughtland
-------------------

Take a look at architecture.scala and types.scala. If you want to contribute a new 
component for any of the four stages, just implement the Traits and send a pull-request.

Developing in Eclipse: you will need to check out OpenSchema and SimpleNLG, install the 
jars from the command line  per the descriptions above, install the scala plugin from 

http://scala-ide.org/download/milestone.html

and add the scala nature to the project plus add the src/{main,test}/scala as source folders
(that seems to be a bug either in the maven or scala plugins or in this project pom.xml).
